    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>These 3-ingredient sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, a party appetizer, a game-day nibble, or a holiday hors d'oeuvre. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for savory, cheesy flavor that can't be beat. These are so yummy! My family makes every Christmas morning.</p>

      <li>1 pound ground pork sausage, at room temperature</li>
